These notes intend to help people working on the checked-out sources.
These requirements do not apply when building from a distribution tarball.

* First Git checkout

You can get a copy of the source repository like this:

  $ git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/mcron
  $ cd mcron

The next step is to get and check other files needed to build, which are
extracted from other source packages:

  $ ./bootstrap

And there you are!  Just

  $ ./configure
  $ make

At this point, there should be no difference between your local copy, and the
Git master copy:

  $ git diff

should output no difference.

Enjoy!

* Submitting patches

If you develop a fix or a new feature, please send it to the appropriate
bug-reporting address as reported by the --help option of each program.  One
way to do this is to use vc-dwim <http://www.gnu.org/software/vc-dwim/>), as
follows.

  Run the command "vc-dwim --help", copy its definition of the
  "git-changelog-symlink-init" function into your shell, and then run this
  function at the top-level directory of the package.

  Edit the (empty) ChangeLog file that this command creates, creating a
  properly-formatted entry according to the GNU coding standards
  <http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Change-Logs.html>.

  Make your changes.

  Run the command "vc-dwim" and make sure its output (the diff of all your
  changes) looks good.

  Run "vc-dwim --commit".

  Run the command "git format-patch --stdout -1", and email its output in,
  using the output's subject line.

* Updating auxilary scripts

  Fetch new versions of the files that are maintained in other GNU
  repositories by running "make fetch".  In case any file in the
  Mcron repository has been updated, commit and re-run the testsuite.

* Code coverage

  Assuming 'lcov' is installed, it is possible to check the actual code
  coverage achieved by the test suite by running the following commands:

  $ make check SCM_LOG_DRIVER_FLAGS="--coverage=yes"
  $ genhtml tests/*.info --output-directory out
