    Released version 0.99.2. (Now fully functional). The CVS tag is
    release_0-99-2 (no branch).

    It has been a long and painful journey, but we have at last worked out how
    to work around all the faults in Guile (an implementation with no threads
    and no UNIX signals!). The code is now really 100% Vixie compatible.


Saturday, 5th July 2003
    Released version 0.99.1, with installation of cron and crontab disabled by
    default (suspect problems with Guile internals are preventing these from
    working properly). The CVS tag is release_0-99-1 (no branch has been created
    for it).


Friday, 4th July 2003
    We have been accepted as a Savannah project. A CVS repository and web home
    page have been created. We're still waiting for acceptance as a GNU project.
