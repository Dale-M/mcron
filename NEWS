    Released version 0.99.1, with installation of cron and crontab disabled by
    default (suspect problems with Guile internals are preventing these from
    working properly). The CVS tag is release_0-99-1 (no branch has been created
    for it).


Friday, 4th July 2003
    We have been accepted as a Savannah project. A CVS repository and web home
    page have been created. We're still waiting for acceptance as a GNU project.
