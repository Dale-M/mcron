    Received a suggestion from Antono Vasiljev to look in FreeDesktop.org's
    standard user configuration directories for user script files.  This is
    implemented in the GIT repository.


Sunday, 20th June 2010

    Standardized the copyright notices on all auxiliary files (including this
    one!) according to the example set by the GNU hello program.  Removed
    immutable end texts from the texinfo document.  These changes are required
    for Debianization.  Released as version 1.0.6.


Sunday, 13th June 2010

    Made some technical changes to the build system to aid Debianization.
    Released without announcement as version 1.0.5.

    The GIT repository has been completely re-hashed, and now represents a
    complete and faithful history of the package's development since its
    inception.

    The source code is now held in a GIT repository, at
    git://git.savannah.gnu.org/mcron.git.

    Released version 1.0.4, under the new GPLv3 license, after some prodding by
    Karl Berry.


Sunday, 16th April 2006
    Released version 1.0.3.  Incorporated many coding suggestions by Sergey
    Poznyakoff, which makes the program work with daylight savings time shifts,
    fixes a bug in parsing Vixie-style input files, allows a user the
    opportunity to correct a crontab entry instead of just wiping out the file.
    Made it work with Guile 1.8.  Updated the manual with GFDL and some minor
    suggestions from Karl Berry.


Monday, 2nd January 2006
    Released version 1.0.2.


Saturday, 15th May 2004
    Set up Savannah and the mailing lists so that we are now homed properly at
    gnu.org. Released version 1.0.1 to reflect this, with CVS tag release_1-0-1
    (no branch). Hopefully we will now get some feedback!


Friday, 12th December 2003
    Released version 1.0.0 through rdmp.org. No CVS tag has been created.


Tuesday, 2nd December 2003
    Mcron is now officially a GNU program. Unfortunately Savannah, the
    development environment, has been mauled so an immediate GNU release is not
    likely. No CVS tag has been created.


Tuesday, 5th August 2003
    Released version 0.99.3. The CVS tag will be release_0-99-3 (no branch).


Sunday, 3rd August 2003
    Broken the code into modules (which is not the same as saying the code is
    broken ;-) ).


Sunday, 20th July 2003
    Released version 0.99.2. (Now fully functional). The CVS tag is
    release_0-99-2 (no branch).


Sunday, 20th July 2003
    It has been a long and painful journey, but we have at last worked out how
    to work around all the faults in Guile (an implementation with no threads
    and no UNIX signals!). The code is now really 100% Vixie compatible.


Saturday, 5th July 2003
    Released version 0.99.1, with installation of cron and crontab disabled by
    default (suspect problems with Guile internals are preventing these from
    working properly). The CVS tag is release_0-99-1 (no branch has been
    created for it).


Friday, 4th July 2003
    We have been accepted as a Savannah project. A CVS repository and web home
    page have been created. We're still waiting for acceptance as a GNU
    project.
