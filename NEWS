    Set up Savannah and the mailing lists so that we are now homed properly at
    gnu.org. Released version 1.0.1 to reflect this, with CVS tag release_1-0-1
    (no branch). Hopefully we will now get some feedback!


Friday, 12th December 2003
    Released version 1.0.0 through rdmp.org. No CVS tag has been created.


Tuesday, 2nd December 2003
    Mcron is now officially a GNU program. Unfortunately Savannah, the
    development environment, has been mauled so an immediate GNU release is not
    likely. No CVS tag has been created.


Tuesday, 5th August 2003
    Released version 0.99.3. The CVS tag will be release_0-99-3 (no branch).


Sunday, 3rd August 2003
    Broken the code into modules (which is not the same as saying the code is
    broken ;-) ).


Sunday, 20th July 2003
    Released version 0.99.2. (Now fully functional). The CVS tag is
    release_0-99-2 (no branch).


Sunday, 20th July 2003
    It has been a long and painful journey, but we have at last worked out how
    to work around all the faults in Guile (an implementation with no threads
    and no UNIX signals!). The code is now really 100% Vixie compatible.


Saturday, 5th July 2003
    Released version 0.99.1, with installation of cron and crontab disabled by
    default (suspect problems with Guile internals are preventing these from
    working properly). The CVS tag is release_0-99-1 (no branch has been
    created for it).


Friday, 4th July 2003
    We have been accepted as a Savannah project. A CVS repository and web home
    page have been created. We're still waiting for acceptance as a GNU
    project.
