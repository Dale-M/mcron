If you have pulled mcron from the GIT repository, these are the steps you will
need to take to build it the first time:

1) autoreconf -vfi
2) ./configure --prefix={wherever}
3) make install


After that it should just be a simple matter of typing `make install' when you
want to build a version with changes in it.
