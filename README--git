If you have pulled mcron from the GIT repository, these are the steps you will
need to take to build it the first time:

1) aclocal
2) autoconf
3) automake -a    (will error)
4) ./configure    (will error)
5) automake -a
6) ./configure --prefix={wherever}
7) make install


After that it should just be a simple matter of typing `make install' when you
want to build a version with changes in it.
