Maybe in the near future...

    *  Logging.

    *  Check POSIX compliance.



There are no plans to actually do the following any time soon...

    *  Develop at, batch modes of operation.

    *  Make compatibilities with other crons (BSD, SYSV, Solaris, Dillon's, ...)

    *  Port to BSD, other operating systems.

    *  Full security audit for Vixie mode.

    *  Move internal functions into a namespace such that configuration files
       cannot interfere with mcron itself.



Quite likely to happen if version 2.0 ever materializes...

    *  Split program into Vixie and mcron separates (should streamline mcron
       code by a factor of three; removes need for security audit).

    *  UNIX or TCP socket will allow interrogation and control of a running
       daemon (should be more reliable, efficient and useful than using the
       SIGHUP-/var/cron/update method).



May happen if version 2.0 ever materializes...

    *  Add anacron functionality (run missed jobs if the daemon is stopped, for
       example if a personal computer does not run 24 hours a day).

    *  TCP socket to allow control via HTTP (web browser interface). Or maybe
       just CGI personality.

    *  GTK+/Bononbo interface.
