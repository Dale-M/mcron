Maybe in the near future...

    * Logging.

    * Check POSIX compliance (should be okay if Vixie cron was okay).

    * Work out how to give each user his own closure (or environment or module
       or continuation) for his configuration files so that he can't mess the
       core or other users' files up. Then allow scheme code in the system
       crontabs.
              


There are no plans to actually do the following any time soon...

    * Develop at and batch modes of operation.

    * Make compatibilities with other crons (BSD, SYSV, Solaris, Dillon's, ...)

    * Port to BSD, other operating systems.

    * Full security audit for Vixie mode.



May happen if version 2.0 ever materializes...

    * UNIX or TCP socket will allow interrogation and control of a running
       daemon (unrelated to, or maybe a major enhancement of, socket used for
       communication from crontab process).

    * Add anacron functionality (run missed jobs if the daemon is stopped, for
       example if a personal computer does not run 24 hours a day).

    * TCP socket to allow control via HTTP (web browser interface). Or maybe
       crontab-like CGI personality.

    * GTK+/d-bus/Gnome3 interface.
