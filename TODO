Maybe in the near future...

    * Logging.

    * Check POSIX compliance (should be okay if Vixie cron was okay).

    * Work out how to give each user his own closure (or environment or module)
       for his configuration files so that he can't mess the core or other
       users' files up. Then allow scheme code in the system crontabs.

    * Move the code into modules so that it can be incorporated directly into
       other programs.
              


There are no plans to actually do the following any time soon...

    * Develop at and batch modes of operation.

    * Make compatibilities with other crons (BSD, SYSV, Solaris, Dillon's, ...)

    * Port to BSD, other operating systems.

    * Full security audit for Vixie mode.



Quite likely to happen if version 2.0 ever materializes...

    * Split program into Vixie and mcron separates (should streamline mcron code
       by a factor of three; removes need for security audit).

    * UNIX or TCP socket will allow interrogation and control of a running
       daemon (should be more reliable, efficient and useful than using the
       SIGHUP-/var/cron/update method).



May happen if version 2.0 ever materializes...

    * Add anacron functionality (run missed jobs if the daemon is stopped, for
       example if a personal computer does not run 24 hours a day).

    * TCP socket to allow control via HTTP (web browser interface). Or maybe
       just CGI personality.

    * GTK+/Bononbo/Gnome2 interface.
