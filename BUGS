* If two users modify their crontabs simultaneously, there will be contention
   for /var/cron/update between themselves and with the main daemon.

* Daylight savings time shifts are not taken into account very well. If things
   are critical, your best bet is to set your TZ environment variable to
   `:Universal', and express all your configuration files in Universal
   Coordinated Time (UTC).

   
   
* As often as not the cron daemon crashes (segfaults) when crontab sends it a
   SIGHUP. For this reason, the current release does not install cron or
   crontab.
