        * Second cut, now _really_ fully functional (100% Vixie
	compatible), production quality code, still needs lots of testing
	doing...

	* Converted from SIGUP-/var/cron/update to select-/var/cron/socket
	method of communication between crontab and cron.

	* Added implicit job which checks every minute for updates to
	/etc/crontab.

	* Removed --enable-vixie configuration option - the Vixie programs
	are built and installed by default now.

	* Bumped version to 0.99.2.
