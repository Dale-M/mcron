	* makefile.am, mcron.c.template (main): Modified install-exec-hook
	so that a proper installation of a Vixie-compatible cron only
	takes place if we are root - otherwise only mcron is installed as
	a user-owned program.  The guile modules are now installed under
	mcron's shared data directory, not guile's global directories.

	* mcron-core.scm: Removed job:advance-time, put the code inline
	where it was called, and changed the instance in the main loop to
	compute the new time based on the current-time, rather than the
	previous job time (this makes things behave more reasonably when a
	laptop awakes from suspend mode).

	* Bumped version to 1.0.2.
	

2004-05-15  Dale Mellor <dale_mellor@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Modified all auxiliary files to reflect that the package is now
	properly homed at www.gnu.org.

	* Bumped version to 1.0.1.
	

2003-12-11  Dale Mellor <dale_mellor@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Modified all auxiliary files to reflect that we are now a GNU
	package.

	* Bumped version to 1.0.0.

	
2003-12-07  Dale Mellor <dale_mellor@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac: Added switches for files and directories used by
	mcron: --spool-dir, --socket-file, --allow-file, --deny-file,
	--pid-file and --tmp-dir. All the code has been modified to use
	these configure options (including the source for the texinfo
	manual).

	
2003-12-05  Dale Mellor <dale_mellor@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac: Added test for guile version >= 1.6.4.

	* bumped version to 0.99.4.

	
2003-08-03  Dale Mellor <dale_mellor@users.sourceforge.net>

        * Third cut, fully functional, modular, production quality, still
	needs testing...
	
	* Pulled all functionality into modules, so it can be incorporated
	into other programs.

	* Bumped version to 0.99.3.
	

2003-07-20  Dale Mellor <dale_mellor@users.sourceforge.net>

        * Second cut, now _really_ fully functional (100% Vixie
	compatible), production quality code, still needs lots of testing
	doing...

	* Converted from SIGUP-/var/cron/update to select-/var/cron/socket
	method of communication between crontab and cron.

	* Added implicit job which checks every minute for updates to
	/etc/crontab.

	* Removed --enable-vixie configuration option - the Vixie programs
	are built and installed by default now.

	* Bumped version to 0.99.2.


2003-06-28  Dale Mellor <dale_mellor@users.sourceforge.net>

	* First cut, fully functional, production quality code, just needs
	testing...

	* Broken/incomplete Guile prevents vixie compatibility from
	working - this has been disabled by default in the configuration.
	
	* Version set at 0.99.1
