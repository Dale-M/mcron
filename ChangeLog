2014-05-25  Dale Mellor <dale_mellor@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Juggled build infrastructure so that we can make the minimal man
	page in the proper autotools way.

	* configure.ac: version to 1.0.8.


2014-04-28  Dale Mellor <dale_mellor@users.sourceforge.net>

	* We now run against, and require, guile-2.0.

	* configure.ac: version to 1.0.7.


2012-02-04  Dale Mellor <dale_mellor@users.sourceforge.net>

	* main.scm: added search for initial files in
	$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cron directory, defaulting to ~/.config/cron if
	the environment variable is not set) as well as in ~/.cron
	directory (this is in line with the current FreeDesktop.org
	standards).


2010-06-13  Dale Mellor <dale_mellor@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac: added --enable-no-vixie-clobber argument to
	configure so that the root user can avoid overwriting a legacy
	cron installation.

	* mcron.1: added simple, minimal man page using help2man (the
	texinfo file is still the primary documentation source).

	* makefile.am: replaced use of mkinstalldirs with install; the
	former is not supplied with the latest automake (1.11).


2008-02-21  Dale Mellor <dale_mellor@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ALL FILES: Replaced version 2 GPL notices with version 3 ones.

	* makefile.am: Do not remove COPYING file with make
	maintainer-clean; if you do it will eventually get replaced with
	the old version 2 GPL by a subsequent automake.

	* configure.ac: Bumped version to 1.0.4.


2008-01-25  Dale Mellor <dale_mellor@users.sourceforge.net>

	* main.scm (command-type): Files which are listed on the command
	line are assumed to be guile configurations if they do not end in
	.guile or .vixie (previously they were silently ignored).

	* main.scm: Argument to --schedule is no longer optional (the
	options system goes really screwy with optional values, usually
	pulling the first non-option argument as a value if one was not
	intended!)

	* makefile.am: Moved target-specific CFLAGS and LDFLAGS to global
	AM_* variables, to remove problem with automake requiring
	AM_PROGS_CC_C_O in configure.ac (!)

	* Version is currently at 1.0.3.


2005-09-02  Dale Mellor <dale_mellor@users.sourceforge.net>

	* makefile.am, mcron.c.template (main): Modified install-exec-hook
	so that a proper installation of a Vixie-compatible cron only
	takes place if we are root - otherwise only mcron is installed as
	a user-owned program.  The guile modules are now installed under
	mcron's shared data directory, not guile's global directories.

	* mcron-core.scm: Removed job:advance-time, put the code inline
	where it was called, and changed the instance in the main loop to
	compute the new time based on the current-time, rather than the
	previous job time (this makes things behave more reasonably when a
	laptop awakes from suspend mode).

	* Bumped version to 1.0.2.


2004-05-15  Dale Mellor <dale_mellor@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Modified all auxiliary files to reflect that the package is now
	properly homed at www.gnu.org.

	* Bumped version to 1.0.1.


2003-12-11  Dale Mellor <dale_mellor@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Modified all auxiliary files to reflect that we are now a GNU
	package.

	* Bumped version to 1.0.0.


2003-12-07  Dale Mellor <dale_mellor@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac: Added switches for files and directories used by
	mcron: --spool-dir, --socket-file, --allow-file, --deny-file,
	--pid-file and --tmp-dir. All the code has been modified to use
	these configure options (including the source for the texinfo
	manual).


2003-12-05  Dale Mellor <dale_mellor@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac: Added test for guile version >= 1.6.4.

	* bumped version to 0.99.4.


2003-08-03  Dale Mellor <dale_mellor@users.sourceforge.net>

        * Third cut, fully functional, modular, production quality, still
	needs testing...

	* Pulled all functionality into modules, so it can be incorporated
	into other programs.

	* Bumped version to 0.99.3.


2003-07-20  Dale Mellor <dale_mellor@users.sourceforge.net>

        * Second cut, now _really_ fully functional (100% Vixie
	compatible), production quality code, still needs lots of testing
	doing...

	* Converted from SIGUP-/var/cron/update to select-/var/cron/socket
	method of communication between crontab and cron.

	* Added implicit job which checks every minute for updates to
	/etc/crontab.

	* Removed --enable-vixie configuration option - the Vixie programs
	are built and installed by default now.

	* Bumped version to 0.99.2.


2003-06-28  Dale Mellor <dale_mellor@users.sourceforge.net>

	* First cut, fully functional, production quality code, just needs
	testing...

	* Broken/incomplete Guile prevents vixie compatibility from
	working - this has been disabled by default in the configuration.

	* Version set at 0.99.1
