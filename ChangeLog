	* mcron.scm: Introduced arbiters to marshall access to updates
	structure between main routing and HUP signal action procedure.

	* crontab.scm: When an empty /tmp file is produced for editing,
	make it owned by the real user (so he can edit it).

	* mcron.scm, makefile.am: Check explicitly for root user when
	running cron personality. Install with only root execute
	permission.

	* mcron.scm: Don't create /var/run/cron.pid if the -s option has
	been used (this is an undocumented possibility).

	* configure.ac, config.scm.in: Added configure option
	--enable-debug to determine whether debugging and traceback should
	be turned on.
	
        * Version bumped to 0.99.2.
